The directory "/abhms/abhms/database/seeders" is intended to contain seeder classes for populating the database with initial data. Since you have not specified any particular seeder class to create, I will provide the contents for a typical seeder file.

Here is the content for a new seeder file, for example, `DatabaseSeeder.php`:

<?php

namespace Database\Seeders;

use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;

class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder
{
    public function run()
    {
        // Call other seeders here
    }
}

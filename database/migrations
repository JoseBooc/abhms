The /abhms/abhms/database/migrations directory is intended to contain migration files for creating and modifying database tables. Since you have requested the contents of the directory itself, it will not contain any specific files yet. 

However, if you need to create a specific migration file, please provide the details for that migration. For now, the directory is set up and ready for migration files to be added.

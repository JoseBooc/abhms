The directory /abhms/abhms/app/Http/Controllers is intended to contain controller classes. Since you have not specified any particular controller to create, I will provide the contents for a default controller file.

Here is the content for a new file named `ExampleController.php` in the `/abhms/abhms/app/Http/Controllers` directory:

<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class ExampleController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return response()->json(['message' => 'Hello, World!']);
    }
}
